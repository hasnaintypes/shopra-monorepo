## Project Philosophy

Shopra is a community-driven, modular SaaS marketplace platform. We value:

- **Clean, maintainable code**
- **Automated testing and CI/CD**
- **Clear documentation**
- **Respectful, inclusive collaboration**
- **Continuous improvement**

---

## Branching Strategy

We use a **Gitflow-inspired branching model** for consistency and reliability:

- **`main`**: Production-ready code. No direct commits. Only merges from `develop` or `hotfix/*`.
- **`develop`**: Main integration branch. All feature, bugfix, and enhancement branches merge here. Should always be stable and deployable.
- **Feature Branches** (`feature/<feature-name>`): For new features. Branch from `develop`. Use kebab-case. Example: `feature/user-profile-editing`.
- **Bugfix Branches** (`bugfix/<bug-description>`): For bug fixes. Branch from `develop`. Example: `bugfix/login-button-not-working`.
- **Hotfix Branches** (`hotfix/<hotfix-description>`): For urgent production fixes. Branch from `main`. Merge into both `main` and `develop`. Example: `hotfix/payment-gateway-timeout`.
- **Enhancement Branches** (`enhancement/<enhancement-name>`): For improvements. Branch from `develop`. Example: `enhancement/improve-search-performance`.

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** for clarity and automation.

**Format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, whitespace, no logic changes
- `refactor`: Code change not fixing a bug or adding a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes
- `ci`: CI configuration or scripts
- `chore`: Other changes not affecting `src` or `test`

### Scope

Scope is optional but encouraged. Use the service, app, or library name (e.g., `svc-auth`, `web`, `libs/ui`).

### Examples

```
feat(svc-product): add product recommendation API endpoint
fix(web): correct issue with product filter component
refactor(libs/kafka-client): improve Kafka connection logic
docs(README): add contribution guidelines
```

8. **Review & Merge**
   - All PRs must pass CI (lint, tests, type checks)
   - At least one code review approval required
   - PRs merged into `develop` after approval

---

## Code Quality Standards

- **Linting & Formatting**: All code must pass ESLint and Prettier checks
- **Testing**: New features/fixes must include unit and e2e tests
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript types
- **Documentation**: Update docs for new features/changes
- **Modularity**: Keep code modular and maintainable

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and small
- Include a description of what and why you changed
- Link relevant issues
- Ensure your branch is up to date with `develop` before review
- Add yourself to the CONTRIBUTORS section in README if it's your first PR

---

## Issue Reporting

When opening issues, please include:

- Clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce (if bug)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant screenshots/logs (if applicable)

---

## Release Process

- Regular merges into `develop`
- When ready for release, `develop` is merged into `main`
- Release notes and version tags generated from commit history
- Hotfixes merged directly into `main` and then back into `develop`

---

## Community & Communication
